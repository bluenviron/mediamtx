hlsSegmentDuration: 1s
# Minimum duration of each part.
# A player usually puts 3 parts in a buffer before reproducing the stream.

# Path parameters

# These settings are path-dependent, and the map key is the name of the path.
# It's possible to use regular expressions by using a tilde as prefix.
# For example, "~^(test1|test2)$" will match both "test1" and "test2".
# For example, "~^prefix" will match all paths that start with "prefix".
# The settings under the path "all" are applied to all paths that do not match
# another entry.
