# RTMP

RTMP is a protocol that allows to read and publish streams. It supports encryption, see [RTMP-specific features](../4-other/24-rtmp-specific-features.md). Streams can be read from the server by using the URL:

```
rtmp://localhost/mystream
```

Some clients that can read with RTMP are [FFmpeg](07-ffmpeg.md), [GStreamer](08-gstreamer.md) and [VLC](09-vlc.md).
