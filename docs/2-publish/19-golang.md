# Golang

You can publish to the server from the Go programming language by using [gortsplib](https://github.com/bluenviron/gortsplib), a RTSP client/server library, and [gortmplib](https://github.com/bluenviron/gortmplib), a RTMP client/server library. Both powers _MediaMTX_ itself. In the repositories of these projects there are several examples on how to connect to a server and push data.
