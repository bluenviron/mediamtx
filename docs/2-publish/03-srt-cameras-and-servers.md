# SRT cameras and servers

In order to ingest a SRT stream from a remote server, camera or client in listening mode (i.e. with `mode=listener` appended to the URL), add the corresponding URL into the `source` parameter of a path:

```yml
paths:
  proxied:
    # url of the source stream, in the format srt://host:port?streamid=streamid&other_parameters
    source: srt://original-url
```
