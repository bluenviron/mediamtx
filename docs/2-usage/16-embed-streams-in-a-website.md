# Embed streams in a website

Live streams can be embedded into an external website by using the WebRTC or HLS protocol. Before embedding, check that the stream is ready and can be accessed with intended protocol by using URLs mentioned in [Read a stream](#read).

## WebRTC

The simplest way to embed a live stream in a web page, using the WebRTC protocol, consists in adding an `<iframe>` tag to the body section of the HTML:

```html
<iframe src="http://mediamtx-ip:8889/mystream" scrolling="no"></iframe>
```

The iframe can be controlled by adding query parameters to the URL (example: `http://mediamtx-ip:8889/mystream?muted=false`). The following parameters are available:

- `controls` (boolean): whether to show controls. Default is true.
- `muted` (boolean): whether to start the stream muted. Default is true.
- `autoplay` (boolean): whether to autoplay the stream. Default is true.
- `playsInline` (boolean): whether to play the stream without using the entire window of mobile devices. Default is true.
- `disablepictureinpicture` (boolean): whether to disable the ability to open the stream in a dedicated window. Default is false.

The iframe method is fit for most use cases, but it has some limitations:

- it doesn't allow to pass credentials (username, password or token) from the website to MediaMTX; credentials are asked directly to users.
- it doesn't allow to directly access the video tag, to extract data from it, or to perform dynamic actions.

In order to overcome these limitations, it is possible to load the stream directly inside a `<video>` tag in the web page, through a JavaScript library.

Download [reader.js](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/blob/{version_tag}/internal/servers/webrtc/reader.js) from the repository and serve it together with the other assets of the website.

If you are using a JavaScript bundler, you can import it by using:

```js
import "./reader.js";
```

Otherwise, you can add a `<script>` tag to the `<head>` section of the page:

```html
<script defer src="./reader.js"></script>
```

Add a `<video>` tag:

```html
<video id="myvideo" controls muted autoplay width="640" height="480"></video>
```

After the video tag, add a script that initializes the stream when the page is fully loaded:

```html
<script>
  let reader = null;

  window.addEventListener("load", () => {
    reader = new MediaMTXWebRTCReader({
      url: "http://mediamtx-ip:8889/mystream/whep",
      user: "", // fill if needed
      pass: "", // fill if needed
      token: "", // fill if needed
      onError: (err) => {
        console.error(err);
      },
      onTrack: (evt) => {
        document.getElementById("myvideo").srcObject = evt.streams[0];
      },
    });
  });

  window.addEventListener("beforeunload", () => {
    if (reader !== null) {
      reader.close();
    }
  });
</script>
```

## HLS

Reading a stream with the HLS protocol introduces some latency, but is usually easier to setup since it doesn't involve managing additional ports that in WebRTC are used to transmit the stream.

The simplest way to embed a live stream in a web page, using the HLS protocol, consists in adding an `<iframe>` tag to the body section of the HTML:

```html
<iframe src="http://mediamtx-ip:8888/mystream" scrolling="no"></iframe>
```

The iframe can be controlled by adding query parameters to the URL (example: `http://mediamtx-ip:8888/mystream?muted=false`). The following parameters are available:

- `controls` (boolean): whether to show controls. Default is true.
- `muted` (boolean): whether to start the stream muted. Default is true.
- `autoplay` (boolean): whether to autoplay the stream. Default is true.
- `playsInline` (boolean): whether to play the stream without using the entire window of mobile devices. Default is true.
- `disablepictureinpicture` (boolean): whether to disable the ability to open the stream in a dedicated window. Default is false.

The iframe method is fit for most use cases, but it has some limitations:

- it doesn't allow to pass credentials (username, password or token) from the website to MediaMTX; credentials are asked directly to users.
- it doesn't allow to directly access the video tag, to extract data from it, or to perform dynamic actions.

In order to overcome these limitations, it is possible to load the stream directly inside a `<video>` tag in the web page, through the _hls.js_ library.

If you are using a JavaScript bundler, you can import _hls.js_ it by adding [its npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hls.js) as dependency and then importing it:

```js
import Hls from "hls.js";
```

Otherwise, you can use a `<script>` tag inside the `<head>` section that points to a CDN:

```html
<script
  defer
  src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/hls.js/1.6.13/hls.min.js"
></script>
```

Add a `<video>` tag:

```html
<video id="myvideo" controls muted autoplay width="640" height="480"></video>
```

After the video tag, add a script that initializes the stream when the page is fully loaded:

```html
<script>
  window.addEventListener("load", () => {
    if (Hls.isSupported()) {
      const hls = new Hls({
        xhrSetup: function (xhr, url) {
          let user = ""; // fill if needed
          let pass = ""; // fill if needed
          let token = ""; // fil if needed

          if (user !== "") {
            const credentials = btoa(`${user}:${pass}`);
            xhr.setRequestHeader("Authorization", `Basic ${credentials}`);
          } else if (token !== "") {
            xhr.setRequestHeader("Authorization", `Bearer ${token}`);
          }
        },
      });

      hls.on(Hls.Events.MEDIA_ATTACHED, () => {
        hls.loadSource("http://mediamtx-ip:8888/mystream/index.m3u8");
      });

      hls.attachMedia(document.getElementById("myvideo"));
    }
  });
</script>
```
