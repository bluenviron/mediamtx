        * Please create a discussion FOR EACH question. Do not ask for multiple questions all at once, otherwise they'll probably never get all answered.
        * If you are asking for help because you're having trouble doing something, provide enough informations to replicate the problem. In particular, include in the question:

          * MediaMTX version
          * precise instructions on how to replicate the problem
          * MediaMTX configuration
          * MediaMTX logs with setting `logLevel` set to `debug`

        * If you are asking for help and you think MediaMTX is misbehaving, open a bug report, NOT a discussion.
