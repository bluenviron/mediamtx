## Describe the issue

Description

## Describe how to replicate the issue

<!--
the maintainers must be able to REPLICATE your issue to solve it - therefore, describe in a very detailed way how to replicate it.
-->

1. start the server
2. publish with ...
3. read with ...

## Did you attach a network dump?

<!--
If the bug arises when using rtsp-simple-server with an external hardware or software, the most helpful content you can provide is a dump of the data exchanged between the server and the target (network dump), that can be generated in this way:
1) Download wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org/)
2) Start capturing on the interface used for exchanging RTSP (if the server and the target software are both installed on your pc, the interface is probably "loopback", otherwise it's the one of your network card)
3) Start the server and replicate the issue
4) Stop capturing, save the result in .pcap format
5) Attach
