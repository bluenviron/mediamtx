        To increase the chance of your bug getting fixed, open an issue FOR EACH bug. Do not report multiple problems in a single issue, otherwise they'll probably never get all fixed.

        The maintainers must be able to REPLICATE your issue to solve it - therefore, describe in a very detailed way how to replicate it.

        Server logs are sometimes useful to identify the issue. If you think this is the case, set the parameter 'logLevel' to 'debug' and attach the server logs.

      description: |
        If the bug arises when using MediaMTX with external hardware or software, the most helpful content you can provide is a dump of the data exchanged between the server and the target (network dump).

        That can be generated in this way:
          1. Download wireshark (https://www.wireshark.org/)
          2. Start capturing on the interface used for exchanging packets
            * If the server and the external hardware or software are both installed on your pc, the interface is probably "loopback", otherwise it's the one of your network card.
          3. Start the server and replicate the issue
          4. Stop capturing, save the result in .pcap format
          5. Attach
      placeholder: Attach the pcap file by dragging it here
